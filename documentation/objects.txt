----------------
Object creation
-----------------

Objects are the core building block of the game, a new object type is defined with 

Troop = Object:extend(),

and whatever :init() function is defined will be called on object creation
the core object code is in engine/game/object.lua

most objects implement GameObject, and have:
:init()
:update(dt) //dt is delta time since last game tick
:draw()

functions, which are called on creation, game loop update, and game loop draw.
The update + draw functions are automatically called, but only after the object is added to a 
Group by setting group = <main.current.ui, main.current.main, etc> in the creation params

An object is created with the form

Troop{group = main.current.main, x = 100, y = 100, ...etc}

params passed in are set as object params in GameObject:init_game_object(args),
(which also adds the object to its group)
so any :init() function needs to set call that function ex:

function Troop:init(args)
    self:init_game_object(args)
end


---------------
Object deletion
---------------

Objects are deleted by setting self.dead = true
Then they will be removed and :onDeath(), :destroy() hooks are called from
Group:update()
on the next game tick

-------------------
Multiple inheritance
-------------------

Objects support multiple inheritance:

Troop:implement(GameObject)
Troop:implement(Physics)

any params and functions on the inherited class will be added to the new class
If the same function is defined in multiple inherited classes (don't do this!), the first one created
takes priority
