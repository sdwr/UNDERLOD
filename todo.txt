PLAYTEST FEEDBACK:
  - special enemy damage reduced at tier 1

  - can beat up to first boss without moving any units, just buying dmg items
    - special attacks dont do enough damage

  - some attacks default to 0/0

  - flat amount of gold per level (even when shop gets expensive)
  - drop gold from enemies? instead of flat per level

  -fire synergy too compliated (does lava stack? does fire dmg on other units stack?)
  - change stack gems to specify "ALL UNITS"

  - change how fire explosion looks (have to know it's player team)
    - make look like healing explosions?
  
  --wisdom talisman vs attackspeed
  -- should be named the same
 
--add 3rd econ item, sack of gold

that makes special enemies randomly drop gold

TODO:

music:
- get demoscene time machine?

second-to-second combat touchup:
-------------------
- add enemy death explosion
- tweak on-hit animation
- level start/ level end animation and sounds
- coin pickups on enemy death
- extra couple seconds on level end to pick up coins
- sound balancing

-- collision and knockback
---------------------
- combined unit physics config into config_physics_object()
- all works like before except player movement is too slow, and too much enemy knockback (can push)

- removed all custom collision except for bosses knocking back players
- try to unify on_collision_enter, and :push() with :launch_at_facing()
- try to unify push distance and duration (how to calc?)

- being_pushed flag disables all other movement I believe
- collision code is in group.lua
- and custom in Troop:on_collision_enter etc

SMALL CLEANUP:  

  --lavaman persists between rounds?

  --archer troop attacks RMB target twice?
    -- something still wrong with cooldown/cast start
    -- should be unified for troops as well

  --progress particles get stuck on walls
  
  --enemy laser tracks too quickly

  -buff/debuff circles should trace boss /special enemy shapes
    -think about going over buff visuals to make sure they are distinct

  --add popup controls on level 1 (disable with checkbox)
    --reenable in settings?
s
  --prevent teams from being selected when all troops are dead
    - code is split between arena/hotbarGlobals/hotbar class/helper
    - the actual team gets selected in helper_unit
    - which is where the check should be
    - but by then the whole selection has already happened in arena/hotbarglobals

  --stompy needs to wander randomly (towards middle of screen)

  --pair melee normal enemy with ranged special and vice versa
    -- add charger enemy
    -- add mspd buff enemy

  --laser enemy rotates at end of precast (wrong state?)
    -retarget in enemy:update()? would have to be in normal state
    
  --stunned laser enemy still fires laser, and has no cooldown ("cast" never triggers, but laser happens in precast)

  --dragon fire particles don't go far enough (and stay after fire ends)
  -- swordsman doesn't target enemy critters

  --Helper.DamageCircle is hurting troops (overkill)

  --troops jitter when aggroing and moving towards enemy
  
  --all items are destroyed exiting buy screen, will trigger consumable effects

--------------
NEW FEATURE PLAN:

get the playthrough to be fun:
  - v2 items
    - add item synergies

    - pass owner unit to :hit() from helper.spell (already done when possible?)

  - add level modifiers (maybe don't need, overlaps with special enemies)
    - berserk
    - infected
    - shielded
    - capture point

  - add passive traits (pick 1 of 3?)
    - lightning damage mult
    - after dealing lightning damage, gain mspd (aspd?) for 3 seconds

    - burn damage lasts longer
    - after dealing burn damage, gain armor for 3 seconds

    - cold slow stacks with itself
    - when a unit affected by cold dies, freeze nearby enemies for 1 second

    - crit chance
    - 

-------------
BUGS:
--------------

quit button disappears after oepning achieve AchievementsPanel
  -looks like it is related to paused state cycling
  -only happens when achievo panel is opened + closed
  - does not happen if options menu is opened + closed before achivements

crash:

movement:
  - rallied units dont attack once reaching the rally point anymore
  

combat:
  safety dance doesn't damage every time
  ghost units stack ontop of each other
  critters arent affected by slow
  basher doesn't work (black circle)
  buffs with same name don't stack properly (first amt gets duration refreshed)
  buffs aren't the right size on all units (hidden under square, too big around rect)

  items too big coming from shop
  saving/enter arena with item on cursor?
  
---------------
CODE CLEANUP:
---------------
  
ui
  - show nice cursor
  - show unit attack CD somehow

shop ui
  - show item cost in corner
  - show troop/item stats without needing to hover

  - disable reroll button when not enough gold
    or on first_shop

  - base class for CharacterCard and CCBuy
  - base class for button (onmouseenter, lock)
  - 

units
  - collision? clustering?
  - add safe unit create that checks for clipping/ finds new spawn
  - turn time
    * already in engine
    * see if attacking requires LoS angle

combat
  - attack timing quantized to beat?
    * classes can have different timings
    * troops within class can be on different sub-beats (1/2/3/4)
    * makes music out of sound effects

---------------
OPTIMIZATION
---------------
stats are recalculated every frame
  switch to "push" system from "pull
  buffs with durations, apply once, then unapply at expiration

lots of n^2 calculations in new spell system
finding targets

------------------

    capture for team heal
    capture for team aspd
    capture to freeze/damage enemies
      unkillable enemies that need to be wiped with capture point?


allies
  needler 
    shoots clip of bullets in random spray around target
  
  bomb dropper

  engineer
    spawns turret
    


enemies
  add annoying flyers (circle around the arena, tiny projectiles that do not too much damage, small hitbox?, don't collide with objects)
  add horde-type summoner (lots of little fast summons)

  add leapers
  add homing missiler
  add ranged archer

  add minibosses
    scaled up versions of regular casters


  add bosses
  ogre boss, big aoe stomp
  snake boss, burrows into ground / charges?
  heigan, safety dance


  - change spawn logic
    * fixed by level?
    * all at once or over time?

allies

  - healers
  healers should also fight
    paladin: heal and tank
    * d̶i̶s̶c̶ ̶p̶r̶i̶e̶s̶t̶ ̶(̶s̶h̶i̶e̶l̶d̶)̶
    * rejuv (hot)

  - rogues
    * stealthed unti attacks
    * leaps backline
    * disengage on low hp?

  nuker (orange)
  - cannon
  - flamethrower


  - leaping zergling

tuning
  - movement
    caster enemies shouldn't chase (bullet-hell/spread, summoners)
      maybe move randomly or try to escape

  - triggers
    * enemies should be able to attack on spawn, instead of waiting full cd
      maybe? easily doable with new spell system

  - spells
      * what to do with overheal/multi-bubble/necromancer if multiple caster pick same target
        * fizzle? go on cd?
